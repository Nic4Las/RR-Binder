# Royal Road Binder
A simple webpage to export novels from [Royal Road](royalroad.com) to the epub Ebook Format. Just copy the url of the novel overview page into the search bar. Currently you can download the Chapters in chunks (maybe i will add an option to specifically select certain chapters later on). Just choose the start, end and chunk size and hit the download button. This page should work on both mobile and pc. Everything runs in your browser. As such there is no backend and all the request are performed from you device. So if you are worried about data usage don't use this on mobile data. I use I CORS Proxy to grab the content of the chapters. Because of the rate limits it takes a while to grab large amounts of chapters. Just leaf the page on in the foreground and wait till the extraction progress is completed. After your chunk is done hit the Download for the finished chunk and enjoy your Novel.
